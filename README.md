# Copilot-Desktop

- **Why?** Because Claude and ChatGPT have a Desktop. You don't have to use this, and this literally **just embeds github.com/copilot while redirecting any other parts of the UI to your browser**.
- **Suggestions? Ideas?** Open an issue/submit a PR. I'll consider them. Just note, this is a personal project with no guarantees. But I'll be willing to collaborate.

Unofficial GUI for GitHub Copilot, made in Electron.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
2. Start the app:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

This will open a desktop window embedding https://github.com/copilot.

**Note:**
- You need a GitHub account and must be signed in within the embedded browser.
- Access to Copilot features depends on your available usage credits (completions and chat). If you have exhausted your free credits, you may need to wait for them to reset or upgrade your plan.
